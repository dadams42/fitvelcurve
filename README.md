This work is the result of a one-week group project at the 2024 Code/Astro workshop at Northwestern University on open-source software engineering for astrophysics.
Title: Open-source package for derived dark matter density profiles from rotation curves.
Description: We fit an NFW profile using dynesty to synthetic (mock) rotation curve data and perform an end-to-end test to validate against the underlying profile for the halo.
