Overview: This work is the result of a one-week group project at the 2024 Code/Astro workshop at Northwestern University on software engineering for astrophysics.

Title: Open-source package for derived dark matter density profiles from rotation curves.

Description: We fit an NFW profile using dynesty to synthetic (mock) rotation curve data and perform an end-to-end test to validate against the underlying profile for the halo. 

Acknowledgments: We thank the team at the Code/Astro workshop for their invaluable help in making this possible, including Sarah Blunt, Jason Wang, and Suchitra Narayana, who oversaw this project.
